Description: # NAME

        # DESCRIPTION
        
        **pydtnsim** is a DTN (Delay/Disruption-Tolerant Networking) simulator written
        in Python.  Since all programs in **pydtnsim** are written in Python, if you
        are a Python programmer, you can easily modify simulator functionalities
        and/or add new features.  Python is one of major light-weight programming
        languages, which enables rapid prototyping of DTN simulations.  For instance,
        when you think of a novel network protocol for DTN, you can rapidly implement
        the protocol with the help of high expressiveness of Python language.
        
        Since almost everything in **pydtnsim** is written in Python, **pydtnsim** is
        not suitable for extremely large-scale DTN simulations.  For instance,
        **pydtnsim** is not suitable for very large-scale DTN simulations with
        millions of agents (i.e., mobile nodes/terminals).  However, such limitation
        is not an issue in practice since DTN is generally expected to be utilized in
        environments with spares agents.
        
        # REQUIREMENTS
        
        - Python version 3.6 or later
        
        - [voronoi program by Steve Fortune](https://netlib.sandia.gov/voronoi/index.html)
        
        # AVAILABILITY
        
          [http://www.lsnl.jp/~ohsaki/software/pydtnsim/pydtnsim-0.1.tar.gz](http://www.lsnl.jp/~ohsaki/software/pydtnsim/pydtnsim-0.1.tar.gz)
        
        # INSTALLATION
        
        An installatoin program using setuptools module is included in the archive.
        
        An example session is as follows.
        
            $ pip3 install setuptools
            $ tar xzvf pydtnsim-<VERSION>.tar.gz
            $ cd pydtnsim-<VERSION>.tar.gz
            $ sudo ./setup.py install
            
        Then, build and install voronoi program.
        
            $ mkdir sweep2
            $ cd sweep2
            $ wget https://netlib.sandia.gov/voronoi/sweep2
            $ sh sweep2
            $ wget http://www.lsnl.jp/~ohsaki/software/pydtnsim/sweep2.diff
            $ patch -b <sweep2.diff
            $ make
            $ sudo install -m755 voronoi /usr/local/bin
